# Java-Image-and-Signal-Processing-Pipeline
This project is a pipeline for processing image and signal data. The image processing component converts images to grayscale, while the signal processing component applies a simple moving average filter to the signal data. The project is implemented in Java using OpenCV for image processing and standard Java libraries for signal processing.
